By longing spot and shorting a dated future, you can profit the difference at the time of the future expiry by selling your spot to the TWAP at the same time the futures contract is resolving. At time of writing, it is possible for these differences to be as much as +4.6% for contracts expiring 6 months in the future. Perpetual futures are different because they don't expire, but this notebook will provide the values for them too.
